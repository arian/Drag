Drag
====

`This has NOTHING to do with official MooTools stuff!`

I've made this version of Drag, which is based on MooTools' Drag versions, for:

- See how Drag works
- To see if there are other implementations possible for Drag
- For the kicks

Please feel free to discuss :)

(Future) Goals
--------------

- Mobile
- HTML5
- Extendable (through Events/Classes)

Drag provides all the pure coordinate and events stuff and has nothing to do with `setStyle`. That's what Drag.Move is for.
Drag.Drop can be used for Droppables.

In theory it should be possible to add the document to Drag and add events, with onStart to check for some selector to get some sort of Delegation.
